A snail climbs a well $x$ feet during the day, and during night, it slips $y$ feet. If the well is $h$ feet deep, how long will it take for the snail to climb?

Solution:


Let $k$ denotes the number of days for the snail climb up the well, $K \in \mathbb{N}$.

If $n \leq x$, $k = 1$.

If $n > x$,
- If $ x \leq y$, $k = \infty$,
- If $ x > y$ : k is the minimum value this inequality: 
$$ (k -1)(x-y) + x \geq h,$$

$$\implies k - 1 \geq \frac{h - x}{x - y},$$

$$\implies k \geq \frac{h - x}{x - y} + 1,$$

$$\implies k = \lceil \frac{h - x}{x - y} + 1 \rceil$$
