title: "Improving Graph Convolutional Networks with Transformer Layer in social-based items recommendation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-kse
excerpt: 'In this paper, we improve the embedding output of the graph-based convolution layer by adding a number of transformer layers. The transformer layers with attention architecture help discover frequent patterns in the embedding space which increase the predictive power of the model in the downstream tasks.'
