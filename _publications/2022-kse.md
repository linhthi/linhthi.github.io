title: "Effect of Cluster-based Sampling on the Over-smoothing Issue in Graph Neural Network"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-kse
excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose the usage of cluster-based sampling to reduce the smoothing effect of the high number of layers in GNN. Given each nodes is assigned to a specific region of the embedding space, the cluster-based sampling is expected to propagate this information to the node’s neighbour, thus improve the nodes’ expressivity.'
