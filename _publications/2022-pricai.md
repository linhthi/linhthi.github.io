permalink: /publication/2022-pricai
excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose the Dynamic-GTN model which is designed to learn the node embedding in a continous-time dynamic graph. The Dynamic-GTN extends the attention mechanism in a standard GTN to include temporal information of recent node interactions. Based on temporal patterns interaction between nodes, the Dynamic-GTN employs an node sampling step to reduce the number of attention operations in the dynamic graph. We evaluate our model on three benchmark datasets for learning node embedding in dynamic graphs.'
