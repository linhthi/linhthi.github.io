# About me
I am currently a Research Assistant and also a Master's student at UET- VNU Hanoi with a focus on advancing graph neural networks (GNNs) architectures.

My research interests include improving the expressiveness, scalability, interpretability, and robustness of GNNs.
I am also interested in working with trustworthy graph learning, such as those that prioritize privacy and fairness.
