# About me
I obtained my MSc. Degree of Computer Science and BSc. Degree of Information Technology at [University of Engineering and Technology- VNU Hanoi](https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/) under the supervision of [Dr. Viet Cuong Ta](https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/~cuongtv/).

Currently, I worked as a Research Engineer (Dec 2023 - March 2024) at [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/), supervised by [Prof. Yuan Fang](https://www.yfang.site/). 

My research interests lie on the expressiveness, scalability, interpretability, and robustness of graph learning models.
I am also interested in working with probabilistic machine learning focus on deep generative models, probabilistic modeling, and uncertainty quantification.

Outside the lab, I enjoy cycling, painting, and gardening.
