# About me
I am currently a Research Assistant and also a Master's student under the supervision of [Dr. Viet Cuong Ta](https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/~cuongtv/) at UET- VNU Hanoi.

My research interests lie on the expressiveness, scalability, interpretability, and robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) architectures.
I am also interested in working with trustworthy graph learning, such as those that prioritize privacy and fairness.
